# 13CM-PA

As there is still is great interrest i decided to put everything online that is
needed to build your own.

This repository hold all public information to construct and build this 13CM-PA.   
It was developed to operate in conjuction with an ADLM-Pluto or similar SDR devices   
for Radio Amateur communications on the Oscar QO100 satellite   

Power Output is around 20W with about 50 db gain   

## Construction

this is straight forward if you have experience in RF circuit and soldering SMD devices.   
Over 20 units have been made. The main part MW7IC2725N is still widely available on    
Aliexpress and Ebay but not always reliable your luck may vary.   

The used SAW filters went EOL beginning 2020. But might be still avialable.   
As a replacement part the TST TA0223A might work but is not tested by me.   

#### Feedback is welcome.   

A more detailed building description is made by Hans PE1CKK and can be found   
on line at http://www.hybridpretender.nl/PA%20assembly%20all.pdf.   

One last warning this is not an easy DIY project but with the right skills its not   
to difficult to achieve good results.   


## PCB

If you want to order a pcb please checkout https://dirtypcbs.com/store/designer/browse/8234   
Check the board thickness when ordering the board, this needs to be set to 1.0 mm.   
The board finish I used was ENIG but HASL should work.
