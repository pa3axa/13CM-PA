It was develope to operate in conjuction with an ADLM-Pluto or similar SDR devices.

## Construction

this is straight forward if you have experience in RF circuit and soldering SMD devices.
Over 20 units have been made. The main part MW7IC2725N is still widely avialable on 
Aliexpress and Ebay but not always reliable your luck may vary. 

One last warning this is not an easy DIY project but with the right skills its not
to difficult to achieve good results.

via hosting with online PCB manufacturer that can handle payment and shipment.
As this is rather time consuming and its my hobby not a business, so drop me an email
